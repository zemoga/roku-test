# Roku Developer Candidate Test


This exercise will be made outside Zemoga and delivered between the next 3 days that follows this test.


## Test Description:

You will need to create a simple Roku app to demonstrate your knowledge of critical concepts such as:

- [x] Fetching data from a server
- [x] Scene Graph component usage
- [x] Video Playback
- [x] App navigation

Note that the list is intentionally quite short to allow you to determine the best way to implement each item. The document provides links to the datasource to use as well as links to the necessary image/video assets, so you should have everything you need to create the app.

There is not necessarily a definitive right-or-wrong way to do each part, **but** you should be able to explain your thought process and reasoning in a following interview.


## Objective

* Build a channel that allows the user to select an item from a list (rowList) by relying in the following services:
  * Categories: [http://34.224.201.25/category](http://34.224.201.25/category)
  * Videos by Category: [http://34.224.201.25/video/category/59246ea5f36d2821ab7a2bf9](http://34.224.201.25/video/category/59246ea5f36d2821ab7a2bf9)

* Requirements: The first row will act as the master head, the second and third as default rowlists, and the fourth as a grid (as seen in the comps).

* Please take into account the comp styles and dimentions i.e the row for Drama has a different tile size. (see the link for comps and dimensions)

* Once an item is selected, a new view should be displayed with a native player reproducing the video. Returning to the main screen should be possible by pressing back in the remote control so the user can select another item.

* Add another feature to enhance the proposed excercise. Use you creativity (a new view, UI enhancement, component, etc).


## Delivery

If time is a constraint, try to resolve what you consider is the most valuable part of the exercise. It is better to focus efforts and show your work quality in a portion of the exercise that solving everything with poor quality ðŸ’¡

Show us a glimpse of what you love to do!  :facepunch::facepunch::facepunch:

Rely on a `readme.m` file to reference any key aspect you want to mention about what you applied in the exercise and in case you were not able to fully solve it, describe how you would handle the parts of the exercise that you couldn't deliver.  Also add any other relevant information about the steps to get the project up and running.

Send a link to your recruiter pointing to your repository (Github, Bitbucket) where  master branch should contain the entire exercise.
